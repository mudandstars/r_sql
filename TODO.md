-   indices
    - allow to add on cols
    - allow a leaf to point to multiple data pages
-   log success responses
-   basic constraints
-   implement DROP and UPDATE and DELETE and WHERE and AND
-   implement WAL
-   log operation time

-   limitations:
    -   I don't handle the case that a single record exceeds the size of a datapage
    -   I don't implement DB metadata like users or privileges
