-   indices
    - NOW:
        - use index file on select
    -   B-Tree
    -   each leaf node points to a data page (fixed size 16kB used by InnoDB by mySQL)
-   basic constraints
-   implement DROP and UPDATE and DELETE and WHERE and AND
-   implement WAL

-   limitations:
    -   I don't handle the case that a single record exceeds the size of a datapage
    -   I don't implement DB metadata like users or privileges
